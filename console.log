No URL: grecy ( 20959 ) no blog url found in Http://theroadchoseme.com<p>After a few years as a Software Engineer I realized sitting at a desk was not making me long term happy. After years of saving and planning I quit to drive around the world. I’ve driven the Pan-American Highway from Alaska to Argentina, right around the coastline of Africa and to all the remote corners of Australia.
More adventures in the works!
